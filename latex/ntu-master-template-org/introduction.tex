% talk about ROI, what it is, why it is important

Attention plays an important role in human vision. For example, when
we look at an image, our eye movements comprise a succession of {\em
fixations} (repetitive positioning of eyes to parts of the image)
and {\em saccades} (rapid eye jump). Those parts of the image that
cause eye fixations and capture primary attention are called {\em
regions of interest} (ROIs). Studies in visual attention and eye
movement have shown that humans generally only attend to a few ROIs.
Detecting~\cite{Christopoulos:05:TJS} these visually attentive regions in images is challenging
but useful in many multimedia applications, such as automatic
thumbnail cropping, object recognition, content-based image
retrieval, adaptive image compression and automatic browsing in
small-screen devices.
