-------------------------[ Sploit Mutation Engine ]-----------------------

Sploit is a framework initially designed for testing network intrusion
detection systems. It is based on a mutation engine that can
automatically apply a number of transformation techniques to an
exploit script.  Using Sploit, it is possible to generate an high
number of mutations of a certain attack that can then be executed
against a real target in a testbed network to test the detection
capabilities of NIDSs.  

It also represents the perfect environment to design, develop and try
new evasion techniques.

Before using Sploit, please read the documentation in the "doc"
directory.  To run sploit, you can use either the command line
interface ("code/sploit") or the graphical interface
("code/sploit-gui").

Have Fun !!

----------------------[ Notes on the Current State ]---------------------

Sploit is still in development and far far away from a stable
release. Changes are made daily and the intrinsic distributed 
nature of the project heavily complicates any testing attempts:
in other words, you can expect to find bugs in this release.
