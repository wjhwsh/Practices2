#Leaves

Leaves is an simple way to present a page-turning interface similar to Apple's iBooks.  It comprises two classes, `LeavesView` and `LeavesViewController`, and occupies less than 100 kB compiled.  It uses only public APIs, sacrificing a portion of iBooks' visual flair to ensure that your application is safe for submission to the App Store.

Leaves supports:

- Text, images, PDFs -- anything that can be rendered in a graphics context
- Drag or tap to turn the page
- iPad- and iPhone-sized display areas 

Leaves does *not* currently support:

- Interactive elements on the page
- Swipe gestures
- Two-page landscape view

Leaves requires iPhone OS 3.0 or later.

#Installation

Add the files in the `Leaves` subdirectory to your Xcode project and ensure that you are linking against `QuartzCore.framework`.

#Getting Started

Creating a page-turning interface is as simple as subclassing `LeavesViewController`:

	@interface ColorSwatchViewController : LeavesViewController
	@end

...and implementing the `LeavesViewDataSource` protocol:

	@implementation ColorSwatchViewController

	- (NSUInteger) numberOfPagesInLeavesView:(LeavesView*)leavesView {
		return 10;
	}

	- (void) renderPageAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index inContext:(CGContextRef)ctx {
		CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(ctx, [[UIColor colorWithHue:index/10.0 
														saturation:0.8
														brightness:0.8 
															 alpha:1.0] CGColor]);
		CGContextFillRect(ctx, CGContextGetClipBoundingBox(ctx));
	}

	@end

For more sophisticated examples, build the Xcode project included with Leaves.

#Notes

Leaves is 100% free to use for any purpose, but [donations](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/11077) are always appreciated and will allow me to spend more time making it the best UIView subclass it can be.

The best way to get an answer to your question about programming with Leaves is the [Leaves Developers mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/leaves-developers), which I keep an eye on.  But if you find a bug, be sure to visit the [tracker](http://github.com/brow/leaves/issues) or message me directly.
